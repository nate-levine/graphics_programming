# graphics\_programming
This repository is for graphics programming endeavors. This project uses OpenGL in C/C++.

### Resources:
- MinGW-w64: To compile.
- CMake: To build.
- GLFW: Handles window creation + API for device input and events.
- GLAD: Handles OpenGL driver pointers and cross-platform functionality.
- GLM: Math library for OpenGL and GLSL. I may replace this with my own math library in the future for fun.
